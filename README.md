# SuiWorkshop

A simple blockchain project built with Sui Move that implements a basic counter module. Users can deploy the module, create counter objects, and interact with functions such as incrementing or reading the counter value. This project demonstrates smart contract development, object management, and on-chain transactions using the Sui blockchain.
